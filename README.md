# MathematicalProgramTutorial
A simple tutorial for using MathematicalProgram in Drake: [drake.mit.edu](https://drake.mit.edu) 

This was originally created for [Underactuated Robotics](http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/underactuated.html), course 6.832 at MIT.

## How to use

The tutorial is written in the Jupyter notebook, and each cell should be runnable if you have `pydrake` and a few other 
standard dependencies (`matplotlib`, `numpy`, etc.).
